Counting unreachable single-side pawn diagrams with limitless captures.

See [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00428.pdf) for more details.

## Remark
Over the last few weeks I've tried to think of an argument to prove that the ratio of unreachable diagrams - and in particular the simplified problem of only considering <em>n-pawn</em> diagrams - tends towards <em>0</em> as board size tends to infinity but to no avail. It seems to me that this is probably true though.
